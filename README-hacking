These notes intend to help people working on the Git version of
this package.

* Requirements

You need the following packages to build the Git version of GNU
Anubis.  We do not make any efforts to accommodate older versions of
these packages, so please make sure that you have the latest stable
version. 

- Automake <http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/>
- Autoconf <http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/>
- Bison <http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/>
- Flex <http://flex.sourceforge.net/>
- M4 <http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/>
- Texinfo <http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo>
- Wget <http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/>

* Bootstrapping

Obviously, if you are reading these notes, you did manage to check out
Anubis from Git. The next step is to get other files needed to build,
which are extracted from other source packages: 

1. Change to the source tree directory

   cd anubis

2. Run

   ./build/bootstrap

This command will download localization files, initialize git
submodules and create the necessary files (configure, etc.)

Use the --skip-po option if you don't need to download localization
files.

3. Proceed as described in the file README (section INSTALLATION).
